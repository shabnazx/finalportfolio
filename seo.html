	 <h2> Code Validation</h2>

	 <p> Code validation is essential as it ensures that you donâ€™t have any errors within your HTML Files and CSS. </p>
	 <h3>How I fine-tuned my portfolio</h3>
	<p> To validate my website, I have used <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" title="html 5 validator">HTML 5 validation tool</a> which requires you to upload to your files onto the site to find out any errors that you have missed. For example, leaving open any Tags or classes. The code validation is also used for CSS; it helps find to any errors that you might have missed for example my CSS coding had a few typos which the validation tool helped me correct.</p>

	 <h4>Page Optimisation </h4>
	 <p> For page optimization I have used<a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/" title="web page test"> webpagetest,</a> the site helps you to find out how fast your site runs for example the first time I tested my website I realised that my website speed was too slow and this was due to my banner image size. To address this I went on Photoshop and resized the image so the file size is reduced. I also lowered the quality of the image slightly so it helps improve the speed of the Website.</p>
       <p>Another very important aspect when developing a website is to make sure that all your images are optimized for the web. This is important because if your images take a big file size then this can lower the speed of running the website as it takes time for it download. To optimize my image file size, I used Photoshop. Photoshop have their own feature to save for the web, one tip that you can use is that you can still keep your image quality high but just lower the width and height and this will keep your file size low. Finally another way to decrease the file size you could put all your social media icons into one image and then use a hyperlink on top to target that specific area. This help increase the speed of the website as its only downloading one image and not a lot of social media icons.</p>

	<h5>Search Engine Optimization</h5>


	 <p>To help increase the search engine optimization I have used Meta Tags. Meta Tags helps with your ranking on the search engine for example by using Meta keywords it is important to put information that specific page is using so that people are able to find it on the search engine. The Meta description Tag is the paragraph that describes what each page is about so people are more likely to select your site in the search engine results.</p>
	 <p>Another way to help with the performance of a website is to get rid of unused CSS. To help me remove my CSS I simply used went on developer tools on google scrolled down to check which CSS I am using. I have removed the unused CSS so this will help my website run slightly faster.</p>
