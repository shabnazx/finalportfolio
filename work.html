	<h2> First Year</h2>
	<p>During my first year at University, I enjoyed the Media Making Unit for this; I learnt the basic of HTML and CSS. I made my first website at University after this I kept on expanding my knowledge and my skills are improving every year. Additionally for this unit I was required to take different types of pictures that show a story. I loved taking photos of objects and I was able to show my creativity side while doing this.  </p>
